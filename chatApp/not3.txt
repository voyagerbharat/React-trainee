Hey!

In the next video, we will setup a new firebase project.

At the time of creating the course, Firebase Realtime Database supported only United States location. In the videos, the location will be the US. However, when you create a new database, firebase will prompt you to select a region, please select either United States or Belgium. Recently Firebase introduced support for a new region Belgium (Europe-west1). Now it is possible to choose a region when creating a new instance of the Realtime Database.

Feel free to choose the closest location but make sure that database URL matches URL in the config (see below):

** If databaseURL is not present in the config, firebase will fallback to the US location.

// misc/firebase.js const config = { // ... databaseURL: "URL_FROM_DASHBOARD" };

 

Keep it up! :)

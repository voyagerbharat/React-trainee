Hey!

An important note here regarding ESLint.

When you install developer dependencies, one of them will be eslint-config-prettier. New versions of this package have affected our ESLint configuration. For that reason, ESLint config must be updated to avoid having a lot of errors (e.g. Unexpected block statement surrounding the arrow body and Failed to load config "prettier/react").

 

Please do that for each project in the course:

Open .eslintrc
Find the following line: "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "airbnb", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
Remove "prettier/react" from the list: "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "airbnb", "prettier"],
Add two more lines to "rules": "rules": { ...your...other...rules...here..., "arrow-body-style": [0], "prefer-arrow-callback": [0] }
Save the file and restart the application.
 

The above steps will match the latest eslint-config-prettier requirements.

Thank you!

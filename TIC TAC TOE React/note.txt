An important note here!

In the next video, we finally start to develop an app. The tool that will power the project is going to be Parcel. The template that we install is called nano-react-app. The template adds the latest and unstable version of Parcel which is bad because it is the latest alpha version. So in the next video right after running npx nano-react-app folderName please do the following to avoid having errors:

Open package.json
Find "parcel": "^2.0.0-alpha.3.2" (or whatever version you have) under devDependencies
Edit the line so it looks like that: "parcel": "1.12.4"
Also in package.json add new resolutions section below "scripts" section: "scripts": { // ... }, "resolutions": { "@babel/preset-env": "7.13.8" },
Also in package.json add one more script fix-parcel to "scripts": "scripts": { "fix-parcel": "npx npm-force-resolutions && npm i && npm i", // ... }
In the terminal (git-bash, bash, MacOS), run one after another: rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json npm install npm run fix-parcel
That's it.

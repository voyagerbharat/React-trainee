Hi there!


In the next video about styles if you encounter a problem with CSS not being applied, please don't panic and continue watching the video to the middle part (~4:50). From 4:50 we will upgrade Parcel and CSS will work as expected.

Below is the explanation of why this happens. Thank you and keep it up! :)

---------------------------
Styles are not loaded with alpha version of Parcel which is ^2.0.0-alpha.3.2.
The problem here lies exactly in the Parcel version and fellow dependencies.
When we installed the nano-react template, it automatically added Parcel with the latest version available to package.json, which at the moment of writing this is ^2.0.0-alpha.3.2 (or higher).
Well, unfortunately, this template installs the latest, but not stable version. This is why it's happening.

Text version how to resolve this (we do this in the video starting from 4:50):
1) Open package.json
2) Find "parcel": "^2.0.0-alpha.3.2" (or whatever version you have)
3) Replace it with "parcel": "1.12.4" and save the file
4) Run "npm install" in terminal

Above steps will downgrade installed parcel version to 1.12.4 which is stable. Moreover, when you will run "npm run start", it must also automatically install you another dependency -> "@babel/core": "^7.11.4" (or higher). Please check package.json after you run "npm run start". If it won't install you @babel/core automatically, then just add it to your dependency list manually in package.json and then run "npm install".

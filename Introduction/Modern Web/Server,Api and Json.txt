Server
Server is basically a computer that responds to the request it recieves

Backend is the code the automatically sends the data depending upon the type
of requests it recieves

API sends the data from database.It is basically a interface a middleman.

Api mostly sends data in form of Json.

Json is data file , JavaScript object Notation

we have two types of server api's -Rest Api(CRUD)
                                   GraphQl(Muatations)



Rest Api -sends all data irrespective of you want or Not

ex /users
   /profile
   /posts/1

   if i just want post tittle i cant get it using rest api ,
   i will get all data of what that api sends me like - title ,id ,body etc.

types of request are get request , post request


GraphQl- in GraphQl we only recieves fields that we ask for.More fast and flexible

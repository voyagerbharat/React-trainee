Single Page Application - Twitter uses React
Everything comes in Js and at first time it recieves some markup and  bundles which have js logics in it ,
so first time it may take time , then it doesn't take time to switch between 
page containers(not refreshed)

Server Side Rendering - Traditional way
Page is refreshed when we clicks on new tab
when we inspect we can see all markup , 
because server sends all markup to your browser when you acess new page



We could altho make a hybrid of SPA and SSR website - but it is more complex

SSR could have staic or dynamic Rendering

In static - we have written specific content for our page
but in dynamic - we have skeleton or template for out content , content may be dynamically loaded and changed
from time into these skeleton or template.

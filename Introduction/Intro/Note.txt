Note
Hey!

Prettier sometimes struggle to recognize JavaScript and React. To help Prettier, you have to:


Open settings.json (press CTRL + P in vscode, type ">settings", select "Preferences: Open Settings JSON")
Add to the config:

"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
"[javascript]": {
"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
},

After that Prettier will magically work as expected ;)
